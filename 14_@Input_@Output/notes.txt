  We can pass Data from Parent to Child.

  child.ts
  @Input user:string = ""

---------------------------------------------------

@Output():

  Note :
  It is used to notify the parent that an event has occured in child component.
  We can pass data from Child to Parent when some event occurs in Child.
  Use EventEmitter to create custom event and emit the data.

  Example : 

  child.ts
   @Output customEvent = new EventEmitter<string>()
   onClick(){
     this.customEvent.emit(this.user)
   }

   parent.html
   <child (customEvent)="handleEvent($event)"></child>
